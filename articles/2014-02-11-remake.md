A bit of a face lift for Parameter(z).

!!!

Lots of things are new and different, but first off let me assure you that the 
_legacy_ site ([parameterz.blogspot.com](http://parameterz.blogspot.com)) is alive and
well and will remain operational for some time.
While Blogger has served me well, I thought it was about time for a change.  

### Newness
There are several new references:

* cardiac z-scores for neonates, infants, and toddlers: [Cantinotti et al., JASE 2014](/refs/cantinotti-jase-2014)
* age, gender, and size adjusted cardiac z-scores for adult echo(!):
[Pfaffenberger et al., Circ CV Imaging 2013](/refs/pfaffenberger-circimaging-2013)
* and [more](/refs/)...

Comparison among references is also much easier as data will now persist from page to page so users
won't have to re-enter the same data.

Also, common measurement [sites](/sites/) let users quickly switch between available and relevant references.
For example:

* [M-mode](/sites/m-mode)
* [Aortic Root](/sites/aortic-root)
* [Coronary Arteries](/sites/coronary-arteries)
