A letter to the authors results in a published correction. Bam. 

!!!

The [last post](/news/2017/02/11/premie-arch-zscores) outlined my problems with trying to calculate z-scores using the 
data published in the article [Normative Values of Aortic Arch Structures in Premature Infants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28139441). 

I had emailed the authors but at the time the calculator went live back in February, I had not yet heard back from them. So I improvised 
and went live with a version that just looked up table data (rather than making discrete calculations). 

Eventually, the authors did get back to me, recognizing that an error had been made. 
Their [correction is published in the July issue of JASE](http://www.onlinejase.com/article/S0894-7317(17)30134-7/fulltext).


The z-score calculations [here](/refs/dijkema-jase-2017) now use the correct(ed) data.

N.B.<br/>

While parameterz.com is not mentioned in the correction, I believe what they are trying to say is "thank you". 

[You're welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM).
