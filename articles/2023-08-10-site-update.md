Mostly a test post to make sure I can update the site...

!!!

It has been a long time since I made an update to this site.
2019 was the last time I updated anything here.
A lot has happened in that time, including how Google runs the App Engine back-end for this site, where the version control repository lives, and a global pandemic.

My personal focus has changed, too.
More on that later.
